Linux :
THIs will disable the internet. We need to let Kali work as a router an enabel the packets to flow through to the internet
enable ip forwarding echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

IPTABLES - modifying routing rules
iptables -I  FORWARD  -j NFQUEUE (specify chain we want to modify e.g. forward - packet which come to our computer
net filter queue   and specify queue in which will trap the packets in
iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
--trap all requests packet from target machinee that usually go to the forward chain...in netfilter queue and queue number 0 
Request-> man in middle trapping request in queue --> forwarding request

--Testing on OWN PC--
iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
-OUTPUT chain for packet leaving my computer....for testing on own machine 
iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
--INPUT packets coming to my computer for testing on own computer directing packets to the queue


iptables -- flush  ( to delete ip tables that were created.whats in the tables)

next we need to access the queue from python 
pip install netfilterqueue


queue = netfilterqueue.NetfilterQueue()
-creating instance of the netfilter ueue object 

queue.bind(0, process_packet)
--connecting the queue with the object "0"
--process packet is a callback function that will be executed on each packet in the queue
--------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env python
import netfilterqueue


def process_packet(packet):
    print(packet)
    packet.accept()

queue = netfilterqueue.NetfilterQueue()
queue.bind(0, process_packet)
queue.run()

this will run and intercept the packages but unless you put packet.accept the target will not be abel to access internet because app packets/requests are in our queue "0"

  packet.drop() - will drop the package and will not allow it to reach the destination(router)
